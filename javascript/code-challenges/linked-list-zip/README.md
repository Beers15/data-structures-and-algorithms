# Singly Linked List v4

## Adds the ability to zip together two lists

This class creates a singly linked list, an abstract data type that can dynamically adds nodes without requiring chunk of memory to be contiguously allocated beforehand.

## Challenge

Create a class that implements a linked list and contains the following methods:

zipLists

You have access to the Node class and all the existing properties + methods on the Linked List class.

Write tests to prove the method can do the following:

    Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
    
    Be able to properly zip lists of different sizes

    keep additional space down to O(1)

    Work even if one, two, or both of the lists passed in are empty
  

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
My approach was rather straightforward for this problem. I started with a basic linked list class from a previous challenge as allowed. I took on one bullet point at a time from the list above. Afterward completing each requirement, I checked for accuracy with unit tests for each (no tests here for the existing linked list methods). There were a lot of edge cases for this one, so this was especially important.

I followed my created visuals for in order to more easily turn ideas into code.

This algorithm took O(N) time, since in every scenario the program iterated over both lists back and forth a single time.

The algorithm O(1) space. A value was needed for iteration and another was needed for saving a node in a temp variable.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
LinkedList: takes in a value as an argument

zipLists(list1, list2)
    Arguments: two linked lists that are objects of this class
    Returns: the zipped list
    This method takes in two lists and weaves them into a single list. One node from each list will be put together in an alternating manner.

kthFromEnd(k)
    Arguments: a number k
    Returns: the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the end of the linked list
    This method looks through the list and returns the value k from the end, if possible. The appropriate error will be thrown if this is not possible.

insertAfter(val, newVal):
    Arguments: a value that should exist in the list and a value to add
    Returns: nothing
    This method adds a new node with that value immediately after the node with the first arguments value

insertBefore(val, newVal):
    Arguments: a value that should exist in the list and a value to add
    Returns: nothing
    This method adds a new node with that value immediately before the node with the first arguments value

delete(val):
    Arguments: a value to delete
    Returns: nothing
    This method searches for the first node with the specified value, and then deletes it from the list

append(val):
    Arguments: a value to append
    Returns: nothing
    This method adds a new node with that value to the end of the list.

insert(val):
    Arguments: a value
    Returns: nothing
    This method adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

includes(val):
    Arguments: a value
    Returns: a boolean
    This method checks to see if the argument is contained within the linked list

toString():
    Arguments: none
    Returns: a formatted string in the shape of,
    "{ val1 } -> { val2 } -> ... -> { valN } -> NULL"
